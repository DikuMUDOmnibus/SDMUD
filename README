Enter the 'src' folder and type 'make' to compile the MUD.
After you have done this, you can browse to the main dir
and execute the startsd script which will attempt to reboot
the mud in case it goes down, or you can run the mud manually
by invoking the following command from the 'area' folder;

../data/sdmud

There is an implementor character called 'Admin' with the
password 'admin' -- you can log on this character, rename
yourself, change your password and use it as your new imp
character.
